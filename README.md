# Basic HTML5 Page with Contact Form

This project is a simple HTML5 web page that demonstrates the core elements of a web document, now enhanced with a contact form for collecting user information.

## Features

- **Title:** Sets the page title in the browser tab.
- **Heading:** Uses an `<h1>` tag for the main heading.
- **Paragraph:** Includes a descriptive paragraph.
- **Image:** Displays a sample image from a placeholder URL.
- **Contact Form:**  
  - Input field for **Name**  
  - Input field for **Email**  
  - **Submit** button  
  - Both fields are required for submission

## How to Use

1. **Download or copy** the `index.html` file from this repository.
2. **Open** the file in any web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
3. **View** the page to see the title, heading, paragraph, image, and the contact form.
4. **Fill out** the form and click **Submit** (note: since the form's `action` is set to `#`, it will not actually send data anywhere by default).

## Customization

- Replace the image URL in the `<img>` tag with your own image if desired.
- Edit the heading, paragraph, and form labels to suit your project needs.
- To handle form submissions, update the `action` attribute in the `<form>` tag to point to your server or form handler.
